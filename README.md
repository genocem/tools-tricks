# Tools and Tricks

Most of what you'll find here are either tools that I found interesting or problems that I got stuck in and want to share to save some people the hassle of research.

You'll notice that most things here are related to **Ubuntu**, since that is my current daily driver, but I hope that you'll find or learn something useful/interesting.
